## What is a RPA?

RPA (Robotic Process Automation)

    -(RPA) is a software technology that enables the creation, deployment, and management of software robots that mimic human activities while dealing with digital systems and software.

    - RPA can not only help you save money on human capital as you expand, but it can also help you avoid the repercussions of human mistake. Aside from the money RPA may save you, it can also free up a lot of time for your existing staff, allowing them to focus on value-added activities like company growth.

## Lifecycle of RPA 

The RPA lifecycle is the framework for delivering and executing automation. It includes all of the stages a bot goes through, from defining a business process or job to automate through its deployment as a bot in production and subsequent continuous monitoring.

RPA lifecycle management refers to how each stage of a bot's life is managed to ensure that it provides the intended value to the company. It provides a process automation framework to guarantee that the bot is developed to meet its needs. It also provides a segmented approach to guarantee that each stage of RPA delivery can be evaluated and enhanced in order to increase execution and performance.

## Stages of RPA
There are seven stages in the RPA lifecycle:

1 - RPA Candidate Identification

RPA stakeholders identify business processes and tasks that are excellent candidates for automation at this level. To find and create candidates, process discovery, task mining, or process mining techniques may be employed.

2 - Assessment & Prioritization

In the assessment and prioritization phase, business processes and tasks identified as candidates for automation are assessed and prioritized for design and development. The assessment involves technical feasibility. For example, suppose the task or process requires too many decisions to be made or interacts with too many systems increasing its dependency complexity. In that case, it may not be a good candidate for automation.

3 - Design

Design as a step in RPA lifecycle management entails identifying and modeling the actual process or activity to be automated, as well as mapping any dependencies that the automation may have, such as the systems with which it interacts or legislation that effect it.

The design phase serves as a roadmap for the RPA developer to understand what needs to be automated. Traditionally, design was finished and packaged in paper-based documents such as PDDs (process design documents), but this technique proved to be error-prone, ushering in a new, digital manner of design.

4 – Development

The RPA developer constructs the bot in the studio of the RPA platform your automation program has enlisted during the development stage of the RPA lifecycle, according to the specifications and definition supplied during the design phase.
Again, employing a paper-based document, such as a PDD, is not the best way to encourage progress. Large BRDs (business requirements documents) have long been demonstrated to be ineffective and prone to rework in software design and delivery.

5 – Testing

The RPA developer or QA team evaluates the automated process in a staging or testing environment to ensure that it executes and operates as planned.

6 - Deployment

Once testing is completed, the bot is deployed in production and runs as configured in the RPA tool’s orchestrator.

7 - Monitoring & Change Management

The bot is regularly monitored in the final step of RPA lifecycle management to analyze performance and guarantee it runs without mistakes.

Because bots have so many dependencies and interact with so many different systems, each change to those systems has an influence on them.

Change management is an important step in the lifespan of a bot. Proactive change management that can predict and rectify change before the bot generates faults may save a lot of money and enhance ROI.
