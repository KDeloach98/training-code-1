## What is RPA
    -Stands for Robotic Process Automation
    -Basically it is a software for robots that run on physical or virtual machine.
    -RPA is automating the mundane and repetitive computer-based tasks and processess in the workplace
    -It is mostly performed in rote, time-consuming fashion

## RPA in key phrases
-*Preconfigure Software*- built-in functionality that needs not much coding but can be customized. An example would be Microsoft Excel where you do not need to continously make a new spreadsheet but can build on it. 

-*Business Logic*- this is known as algorithms and codes to make a piece of software work for the company's customers and servers. An example is that it does more of behind-the-scenes data processing that critical to keep things running well together but is invisible to the user. 

-*Predifined Activity Choreography*- this uses a sequence of steps needed to complete an action across all systems and applications. An example balancing taxes on inaccurate invoices. 

-*Autonomous Execution*- tasks are completed by software bots indepedently. 

-*One or more unrelated software systems*- RPA tool used for front-end-applications kind of like how people interact with everything. An example is Internet, Explorer, Outlook, Oracle, Etc.

    -*Human Exception Managaement*- employees are involved in this RPA tool with resolving unpredicted events or performing cognitive actions. An example, inputting data to full stepping in where the employee handles the entire process. 

## RPA Lifecycle

    -The RPA lifecycle is the framework for delivering and executing automation. It includes all of the stages a bot goes through, from defining a business process or job to automate through its deployment as a bot in production and succeeding continuous monitoring.

## Different Stages of the Lifecycle

-There are seven stages in the RPA lifecycle:

        1 - RPA Candidate Identification

        RPA stakeholders identify business process and tasks that are excellent candidates for automation at this level. To find and create candidates, process discovery, task mining, or process mining techniques may be employed.

        2 - Assessment & Prioritization

        In the assessment and prioritization phase, business processes and tasks identified as candidates for automation are assessed and prioritized for design and development. The assessment involves technical utility. For example, suppose the task or process requires too many decisions to be made or interacts with too many systems increasing its dependency quality. In that case, it may not be a good candidate for automation.

        3 - Design

        Design as a step in RPA lifecycle management entails identifying and modeling the actual process or activity to be automated, as well as mapping any dependencies that the automation may have, such as the systems with which it interacts or legislation that effect it.
        The design phase serves as a roadmap for the RPA developer to understand what needs to be automated. Traditionally, design was finished and packaged in paper-based documents such as PDDs (process design documents), but this technique proved to be error-prone, ushering in a new, digital manner of design.

        4 – Development

        The RPA developer constructs the bot in the studio of the RPA platform your automation program has enlisted during the development stage of the RPA lifecycle, according to the qualifications and definition supplied during the design phase. Again, employing a paper-based document, such as a PDD, is not the best way to encourage progress. Large BRDs (business requirements documents) have long been demonstrated to be ineffective and prone to rework in software design and delivery.
        
        5 – Testing

        The RPA developer or QA team evaluates the automated process in a staging or testing environment to ensure that it executes and operates as planned.
        
        6 - Deployment

        Once testing is completed, the bot is deployed in production and runs as configured in the RPA tool’s orchestrator.

        7 - Monitoring & Change Management

        In the final stage of RPA lifecycle management, the bot is continuously monitored to assess performance and ensure it runs without any errors.

        Because bots have so many dependencies and interact with different systems, they are impacted by any change to those systems. Change management is a key stage in a bot’s lifecycle. Proactive change management that can anticipate and correct change before the bot produces errors can prevent a lot of value lost to downtime and increase ROI.

## RPA Lifecycle Management

    -RPA lifecycle management refers to how each stage of a bot's life is managed to ensure that it provides the intended value to the company. It provides a process automation framework to guarantee that the bot is developed to meet its needs. It also provides a divided approach to guarantee that each stage of RPA delivery can be evaluated and enhanced in order to increase execution and performance.

## Different RPA Vendors

    -Incredible Efficient Way To Perform Automations And Procedures;
    -This tool has many commands with which we can be used to automate most      manual tasks. 
    -It can also be used to customize the commands to fit company's requirements. 
    -The evolution of the platform and the features covers more and more business cases and it also helps users in a high execution of processes and reduces the expenses of automation of their corporations. 
    This application can also be used to improve the customer experience, the execution of SQL queries which helps to access the database easily. 
    -It has a good amount of built-in activities to get work done easily and helps automate a routine job.
    -It is a great RPA solution that has been implemented to help users automate tasks and save costs in return.
